20,How can you return an iterator from a function in Python?,,"The function should use the 'yield' keyword to return an iterator. For example, a function which returns a range of integers from 0 to 10 can be written as follows: 

def int_range():
    for i in range(10):
        yield i

This function returns an iterator which produces the values from 0 to 10."
21,What is the equivalent of the break statement in a while loop in Python?,,"The equivalent of the break statement in a while loop in Python is the 'continue' statement.

90,What are the advantages and disadvantages of using lists over tuples in python ?,,"The major advantages of using lists over tuples in Python is that lists are mutable, which means they can be changed in place whereas tuples are immutable. Additionally, lists use less memory and are easier to work with when dealing with larger data sets. 

The major disadvantage of using lists is that they can contain any type of data, which can introduce bugs. Furthermore, since lists are mutable, it can be difficult to ensure data integrity when multiple variables are referencing the same list. Tuples on the other hand, can only contain a limited set of objects, and are immutable, which can help maintain data integrity when dealing with large data sets or when multiple variables need to reference the same tuple."
91,How can someone sort a list by two criteria in python ?,"my_list = [('a', 5), ('b', 2), ('c', 7)]","We can sort a list by two criteria in Python using the sorted() function.  The sorted() function takes a key and a reverse argument as parameters. The key argument can be used to specify a function that will be used to extract a comparison key from each element in the list. The reverse argument, when set to True, will sort the list in descending order. 

For example:

my_list = [('a', 5), ('b', 2), ('c', 7)]
sorted_list = sorted(mylist, key=lambda score: score[1], reverse=True)

Where the sorted_list would be: [('c', 7), ('a', 5), ('b', 2)]"
92,How can someone count the unique elements in a list ?,"my_list = [2, 4, 6, 8, 2]","We can count the unique elements in a list using Python's built-in set() method. The set() method will take a list as an argument and return back a set of unique elements in the list. We can then count the number of unique elements by getting the length of the set. 

For example:

my_list = [2, 4, 6, 8, 2]
unique_elems = set(my_list)
number_of_unique_elems = len(unique_elems)

Where number_of_unique_elems would be: 4"
93,How can someone access a value at a given index in an array ?,"my_array = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]","We can access a value at a given index in an array using the square bracket notation. The square bracket notation takes the index number as an argument and returns the value at that index. The indexing of Python arrays starts at 0. 

For example:

my_array = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
value_at_index_3 = my_array[3]

96,How add independent tasks to the current script ?,"import os, glob import subprocess def execute task cmd script path with open cmd script path 'r' as f code exec f exec exec 'nohup python test script.py &' os chdir script path result os system cmd return result","To add independent tasks to the current script, first create a python script file containing the task(s) to be executed (e.g. test_script.py). Then, use a combination of the Python function exec() and the os.system() command from the os library to execute the task in a new shell script, ensuring that the task can run in the background as an independent process. The code will look something like this: exec(open(""test_script.py"")) exec(""nohup python test_script.py &"") os.chdir(script_path) result = os.system(cmd) return result"
97,Why format the data ?,data[ 'description '] = str format description data,"Formatting the data is important to ensure that the data is in a standard, readable format for all programs.

461,How to sort a given dictionary based on the values ?,"dict = {'a': 4, 'b': 2, 'c': 1, 'd': 3}","The given dictionary can be sorted based on the values by using the sorted() function with the keyword argument ""key"". The sorted() function takes a keyword argument ""key"" which is a function to be called on each element of the iterable. This ""key"" function will be called on each element (key-value pair) of the dictionary and it will return the value to be used to order the elements. To order the given dictionary based on the values, a lambda can be used as the key. For example: 

sorted_dict = sorted(dict.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])

print(sorted_dict) # Prints [('c', 1), ('b', 2), ('d', 3), ('a', 4)]"
462,How to detect a duplicate in a given list of strings ?,"strings = [""apple"", ""banana"", ""carrot"", ""apple"", ""kiwi""]","To detect a duplicate in a given list of strings, a set can be used. A set in Python is a collection that can store unique elements only. To detect a duplicate, all the elements from the list can be added to a set. If the same element already exists in the set, it will be ignored. Depending on the desired output, the program can either output the duplicate element or the list of unique elements. For example: 

unique_strings = set(strings)
duplicate = []

for string in strings:
    if string in unique_strings:
        unique_strings.remove(string)
    else:
        duplicate.append(string)

988,What are classes in Python used for?,,"Classes in Python are a powerful way of creating objects which can be used to represent real world entities and facilitate code re-usability by defining common attributes and behaviours once, thus avoiding code repetition. Additionally, classes also offer a natural way of organizing code, enabling the user to build complex applications using an object-oriented programming approach."
989,How to check if a string is an integer ?,,"The easiest way to check if a string is an integer is by using the isdigit() method. This method will return True if the given string is an integer, False otherwise. For example, if the string is ""50"", the isdigit() method will return True."
990,What is the output of print (x << y)?,"x = 4
y = 3","The output of the print (x << y) statement in Python is 32. This is because the left-shift operator (<<) shifts the bits in the number x to the left by a given number of positions y, multiplying the number x by 2^y."
991,How does the break statement work in Python?,,"The break statement is used to exit a loop when a certain condition is met. It can be used to terminate the loop when a certain condition is met or when a user wishes to discontinue the execution of the loop prematurely. The break statement is used inside the loop to exit the loop, and any following loop statements will not be executed."
992,How do you generate the Fibonacci sequence in Python?,,"The Fibonacci sequence can be generated in Python by using a while loop, with the starting values of two and one. In each iteration of the loop, the values are updated with the sum of the two previous values, and the result is appended to the list. This process continues until the desired number of values is reached."
993,How do you use the assert statement in Python?,,"The assert statement in Python is used to validate a condition. It checks if the given expression is true, and if not, it raises an AssertionError with the given error message. The assert statement is used to catch user-defined errors during execution and to provide informative error messages which can help in debugging."
994,What is the output of the print (list [0:2]) statement?,"list = [10,20,30,40,50]","The output of the print (list [0:2]) statement in Python is [10,20]. This is because the syntax list[start:stop] will return a list from the start index (in this case 0) up to but not including the stop index (in this case 2). So list[0:2] will return elements from index 0 to index 1, which are 10 and"
995,Explain the “pass” statement,,"The ""pass"" statement in Python is used as a placeholder when there is a syntactically valid statement but no code to execute. It does nothing other than indicating the control flow should proceed to the next statement. It is a null operation, which may be useful when using loops inside a code block."
996,Write a function to print the larger of two numbers,def larger_of_two a b,"if a > b:
    print(a)
  elif b > a:
    print(b)
  else:
    print('The numbers are equal.')"
997,"Explain the ""try and except"" block",,"The ""try and except"" block is used to detect errors in a program and handle them gracefully. The code inside the try block is executed, and, if an error occurs, any code inside the except block is executed. This prevents the program from crashing and allows it to continue working in the case of an error."
998,How can you store multiple items in Python?,,"In Python, there are several data structures which can be used for storing multiple items. These include lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets. Each of these data structures has a specific purpose and type of items it can store, which makes them useful for different tasks."

1005,What is a better way to write this code?,def get reversed str rev str for i in range len str rev str i str len i 1 return rev str,"This code can be improved by using the reversed() function. The reversed() function returns an iterator object which iterates through the given sequence from the last element to the first element. The same code can be written using the reversed() function as follows:

def getReversedStr(str): 
    return ''.join(reversed(str))"
1006,How can a variable be set?,,"A variable can be set by assigning a value to it using the assignment operator (=). For example, if a variable named message is required, it can be set as follows:

message = ""Hello World""

This will set the variable message to the value ""Hello World""."
1007,How can a user input be collected and stored?,,"A user input can be collected and stored in Python using the input() function. This function takes a string as an argument which is displayed to the user when they are asked for input. The user response is then stored in a variable and can be used for further processing. For example, a string can be stored in a variable called message as follows: 

message = input(""Enter a message: "") 

This statement will prompt the user to enter a message which is then stored in the variable message."
1008,How could a for loop be used to loop through a list of elements ?,"my_list = ['apple', 'banana', 'strawberry', 'pineapple']","for item in my_list:

1015,How can we use a dictionary to check if a key exists ?,"mydict = {""key1"": ""Value1"", ""key2"": ""Value2"", ""key3"": ""Value3""}","We can use the 'in' operator to check if a key exists in a dictionary. For example, to check if ""key2"" exists in the dictionary 'mydict', we can use the expression ""if 'key2' in mydict:"". This expression returns True if the key is present in the dictionary and False otherwise."
1016,Adapt the following code to re-arrange the tuple ?,def rearrange_tuple t (a b ) t ( b a ),def rearrange_tuple = t (a b ) t = ( b a ) # switch the elements in the tuple and assign to a new tuple
1017,Sum the list of numbers ?,"li = [25, 17, 12, 32]","The sum of the list [25, 17, 12, 32] is 86. This can be calculated with the Python `sum()` function, which takes an iterable (e.g. a list) and returns the sum. sum(li) will return 86."
1018,Reverse a string ?,"string = ""hello world""","The string ""hello world"" can be reversed by using Python's `[::-1]` slicing technique, which reverses the order of characters in a string. Applying this technique to the string ""hello world"" will return the string ""dlrow olleh""."
1019,Find the index of an item in the list ?,"my_list = [""apple"", ""banana"", ""cherry""]","The index of an item in a list can be found by using the `list.index()` method, which takes as argument the item to be found, and returns the index of that item. For example, using the list `my_list = [""apple"", ""banana"", ""cherry""]`, the index of the item ""cherry"" can be found by calling `my_list.index(""cherry"")`, and the result will be 2."
1020,Print a random item from the list ?,"my_list = [""apple"", ""banana"", ""cherry""]","A random item from the list `my_list = [""apple"", ""banana"", ""cherry""]` can be printed by using Python's `random.choice()` method, which takes in a list as input and returns a randomly chosen element. For example, `random.choice(my_list)` will print out one of the items from the list."
1021,Create an array of 5 random numbers ?,,"An array of 5 random numbers can be created in Python by using the `random.sample()` function, which takes integers `(a, b)` and returns a list of `k` elements, where `k` is the specified size of the array. For example, the following will create an array of 5 random numbers between 0 and 10: `random.sample(range(0, 10), 5)`."
1022,Is the following input valid code ?,def is_valid code if type code == str and code ! = '' return True else return False,"Yes, the following input is valid code.

1025,Remove vowel characters from a string ?,"string = ""hello world""","The vowel characters from the string ""hello world"" can be removed by using Python's `str.replace()` function. This function takes two arguments, the substring to be removed and the substring that will replace it. The vowel characters (a,e,i,o,u) can be removed with the replace function by calling `string.replace(""[aeiou]"", """")`. This will remove all vowel characters from the string and return the string ""hll wrld""."
