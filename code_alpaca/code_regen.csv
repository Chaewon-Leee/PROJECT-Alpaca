The method returns the index at which the substring was found or -1 if the substring was not found. 

In this example, the ""find()"" method can be used with the substring ""is"" as the first argument and 0 as the optional start argument to search for the substring."
How to use a stack to sort a list ?,"unsorted_list=[3,5,2,9,1]","To use a stack to sort a list, first push all elements of the unsorted list to the stack. Then, start popping the elements from the stack one by one and compare the popped elements in order to push the element that is the largest into a separate stack and the remaining elements back to the original stack. This process is repeated until all the elements are in the separate stack. Finally, pop each element from the separate stack and append to the same list in order to get a sorted list."
What is the best way to check if a string is a palindrome ?,"string = ""abba""","The best way to check if a string is a palindrome is to use the built-in ""reverse()"" function in conjunction with the ""equal()"" function. The ""reverse()"" function takes a string and reverses the characters in the string to create a new string. The ""equal()"" function compares two strings and returns true if they have equal values. In this example, the string is compared to its reversed version using the ""equal()"" function. If the two strings are equal, then the original string is a palindrome."
How to know the total number of arguments passed into the function ?,"def func a b c

This function takes the list (in this case, the argument list of the function) as an argument and returns the number of elements present in the list. In this example, the ""len()"" function will return 4, indicating the total number of arguments passed into the function."

What is the difference between a list and a tuple ?,"a list = [1,2,3] 
b tuple = (1,2,3)","The main difference between a list and a tuple is that a list is mutable, meaning that it can be changed and elements can be added or removed, while a tuple is immutable, meaning that it cannot be modified. Another difference is that while elements of a list can be of different types, elements of a tuple all must have the same data type."
How can we access the third element of the list ?,"nums [1,54,18,7,9]","We can access the third element of the list by using the index of the element. For example, we can use nums[2] to access the third element (counting from 0)."

def base_handler msg '{}'.format(msg) 

This will ensure that a descriptive message is raised and that the msg variable is accurately represented."
How can functions be implemented to check for errors in the code ?,None,"Functions can be implemented to check for errors in the code by utilizing assertions. Assertions are statements that raise an assertion error when a condition is not met. These assertions can be implemented within a function to validate the input. This will allow the code to check for errors without needing to execute the full function. This can be done as follows:


def function(parameter):
asssert parameter is not None

This code checks that the parameter is not None. If it is not None then the function will continue as normal, but if it is None, then an assertion error will be raised, indicating that an error has occurred. This allows for errors to be checked before the full function is executed."

Create an algorithm to sort a list of tuples ?,"list_to_sort = [(3, 1), (2, 4), (1, 8), (9, 5)]","One efficient algorithm for sorting a list of tuples is to first create a new list of tuples that are sorted based on the first element in each tuple. This can be done by simply looping through each element in the list and inserting it in the correct spot in a new list based on its first element. Once that is done, then we can simply sort the new list in place with the list.sort() method in Python. The algorithm would look like this:

def sort_tuples(list_to_sort):
    new_list = []
    for element in list_to_sort:
        i = 0
        while i < len(new_list) and element[0] > new_list[i][0]:

What is the most efficient way to find the maximum value in a list?,"my_list = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]","The most efficient way to find the maximum value in a list is to use the built-in `max()` function.

Create a program to remove duplicates from a list ?,"my_list = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4]","One way to create a program to remove duplicates from a list is to first create a new empty list that will store the modified version. Then loop through the given list, and use the `.append()` method of the new list to check if an element already exists in the new list. If an element does not exist in the new list, then it will be appended, otherwise it will be ignored. The algorithm would look like this:

def remove_duplicates(my_list):
    new_list = []
    for element in my_list:
        if element not in new_list:
            new_list.append(element)

    for item in list1:
        if item not in list2:
            missing_items.append(item)
    return missing_items","The code is not efficient because it uses a `for` loop to compare each element in list1 to every element in list2. Since the time complexity of this algorithm is O(n*m) (where n and m are the lengths of list1 and list2 respectively), it takes a lot of time to execute with large size of lists. A more efficient way would be to use the `set()` data structure. By using the difference between two sets, we can find the elements that are present in list1 but not in list2 in a single operation, thus reducing the time complexity to O(n). The improved code would look like this:

def find_missing(list1, list2):
    s1 = set(list1)

    return list(s1 - s2)"
