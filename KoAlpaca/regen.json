It also allows users to share media, engage in conversations, and follow other people's posts. \n\nInstagram focuses more heavily on visual content, while Twitter has fewer restrictions on text-based content. Additionally, Instagram has more features to help create and curate visually appealing content such as filters and stories. Twitter, on the other hand, encourages users to keep their content brief, as posts can only be up to 280 characters in length.",

This means that one of the four slices is being selected, which is the same as one fourth of the pizza.
